# üí´ About Me:
I am an experienced network engineer and system administrator with 10+ years of IT background. I am currently completing an advanced long-term training course for a DevOps engineer. I am going to develop my career in the DevOps direction.<br>I get most of my key skills working in Moscow, and now it looks that it‚Äôs a right moment to me to step out of the boundaries and to pursue my dream to live and work in Europe.<br>I have extensive experience in administering both Linux and Windows servers. I am also well versed in networks and network equipment (VPN, routing, OSPF, TCP / IP), I have worked and have experience in implementing version control systems and CI/CD (GitLab, Jenkins), containerization and orchestration systems (Docker, Docker-compose, Kubernetes, ArgoCD), as well as monitoring and alerting systems (Zabbix, Nagios, Cacti, Grafana, Prometheus).<br>My advanced IT experience is enriched by my economics education and high communication skills, which helps me to understand the business processes and needs and create and implement optimized solutions for the business, the team, and customers. I managed to cope with stressful situations. Usually, I don‚Äôt tend to give up in front of difficulties. Instead I try to gain new learnings from failures to improve the processes and my expertise. I am a fan of cohesive teamwork. People could rely on me.<br>I am a curious explorer and fast learner, trying to develop my hard and soft skills. By the way, I like motorcycling, traveling, and scale modeling.
